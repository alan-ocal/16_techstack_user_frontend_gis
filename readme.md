## OpenLayers + Accessible
### description
- This is the standard "zoom in & out" example for displaying an OpenStreetMap map on a web page.
When the map element is focused the + and - keys can be used to zoom in and out and the arrow keys can be used to pan.

### setup
This example demonstrates how the `ol` package can be used with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).

To get started, run the following (requires Node 14+):

    npx create-ol-app my-app --template vite

Then change into your new `my-app` directory and start a development server (available at http://localhost:5173):

    cd my-app
    npm start

To generate a build ready for production:

    npm run build

Then deploy the contents of the `dist` directory to your server.  You can also run `npm run serve` to serve the results of the `dist` directory for preview.
