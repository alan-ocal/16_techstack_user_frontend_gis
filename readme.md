## OpenLayers + Basics

### description
- This is the standard "Hello World" example for displaying an OpenStreetMap map on a web page.

it installs OpenLayers and a development server, and set up a basic app with `index.html`, `main.js`, and `style.css` files.

- The HTML markup with an element to contain the map (`index.html`)
- The JavaScript that initializes the map (`main.js`)
- The CSS styles that determine the map size and any other customizations (`style.css`)

### setup
The development setup uses OpenLayers v10 (Current) Node (14 or higher) and requires that you have git installed.
it demonstrates how the `ol` package can be used with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).

To get started, run the following (requires Node 14+):

    npx create-ol-app my-app --template vite

Then change into your new `my-app` directory and start a development server (available at http://localhost:5173):

    cd my-app
    npm start

To generate a build ready for production:

    npm run build

Then deploy the contents of the `dist` directory to your server.  You can also run `npm run serve` to serve the results of the `dist` directory for preview.
